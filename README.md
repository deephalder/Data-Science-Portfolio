#### Similar Movie Recommendation System.

[Github](https://github.com/deephalder/Personal-Code/blob/main/Kaggle/Movie_recommended_system/movie-recommendation-system-content-based-easy.ipynb) 

[Live app URL link ](https://similar-movies.herokuapp.com)

Recommenders are systems, which predict ratings of users for items. There are several approaches to build such systems and one of them is Collaborative Filtering. 

This notebook and app, shows a recommendation system where the user selects a movie from the list of top 5000 movies and it gives you the top 5 most similar movies along with their images.

This notebook is also deployed in Heroku , so you can use the app using this URL : https://similar-movies.herokuapp.com

#### Book Genre Predition and recommendations.

This a machine learning project where the user enters a summary or description and the app directly predicts a genre fit for the summary, and then finds similar books based on the summary's closest cosine similarity score.
The data for books were first scraped from goodreads and then the model was trained to predict the summary.
